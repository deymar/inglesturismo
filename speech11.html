It is important to make creativity a value for corporations, and that will be part of culture in a hotel. Also, managing creativity will lead this to emerge as something natural. Culture and values of a corporation will help to create an appropriate atmosphere for ideas to be treated with respect and importance. <br>
There are different values of corporations that should promote an appropriate environment to develop more ideas and put them into action, such us: Accept errors, cooperation and teamwork, autonomy, continuous improvement and flexibility Also quality is important and the meaning is the standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind; the degree of excellence of something. According to ISO 9001,  is the degree in which a set of characteristics inherent to an object (product, service, process, person, organization, system or resource)  meet the requirements of client. 
There are different management systems that can be implement in hotels. The systems will help to manage the resources better.  <br>
Management Systems <br>
• ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems) <br>
It provides infrastructure, procedures, processes and resources, needed to help  organizations, besides, control and improve the performance of the organization. It gives reputation to the organization. Moreover it leads to customer satisfaction and competitive satisfaction. <br>
• ISO 14001 (Enviromental Management) <br>
It Helps the organization to identify, prioritize and manage enviromental risk, as a part of usual business practices, also reduce waste and improve overall environmental impact. It gain competitive advantage in supply chain design and manage environmental obligations with consistency . <br>
• ISO 9001 + 14001 (Integrate Management System) <br>
Integrates all of an organization’s systems and processes into one complete framework. Enable an organization to work as a single unit with unified objectives. Manage business risk and save human resource, finally facilitate continuous improvement. <br>
• ISO 22001 (Food Management) <br>
Controls risks for Food Security through essential requirements programs and risk analysis plans and critical control points. It includes food safety that is linked to the food hazards that appears on the point of consumption.
• Q OF TOURIST QUALITY <br>
This management system was created specifically for each sector, such as: hotels, restaurants, agrotourism. It is kind of ISO 9001, but it is specialized and adapted for each tourist establishment <br>
However, the specialization in  the service is a strategy to be different from the competition. Specialization models can be: hiking, cycle tourism and others. The quality management system implemented will depend on the particular needs of each tourist.   <br>
In Bolivia  we have IBNORCA that is institute for standardization and quality (privite non profit association) It is in charge of two important pillars of quality: Technical normalization and quality certification. It leads management to the sastisfaction of the customer and active participation of people and obtain guarantee competitive development.  <br>
