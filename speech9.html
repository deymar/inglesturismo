                <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">
In recently years, travelling beyond being just a way of entertainment and just an activity
to escape from responsibilities and take a breath from stress of your own environment; it
has becomed in one of all the necessities that people have to feel alive and healthy. Taking
into account that every year the number of destinations around the world extends, now I
will show some of the best travelling places you could visit in 2019.

According to U.S. News &amp; World ReportÂ´s Top 30 best places to visit in 2018- 2019, the
top 10 of most recommended are: Argentina, Dubai, Thailand, New Zealand, London,
Polynesia, Rome, U.S.A, and France. Forbes Magazine and other tops also includes:
Mexico, Cuba, Colombia and the Caribbean within its lists. Most of this destinations
contemplate to have a great time and the experience of different types of tourism which are
trends currently.

In spite of the magnificence and the amusement that the visit to these beautiful places
represents, especially in countries such as Bolivia, certain aspects of disadvantage. Two
barriers that prevent the realization of a foreigner could be: First, the cost of an abroad
journey represents a luxury for people who do not receive enough salary. And the
processing time of the visa, insurance and travel agenda involve relatively long periods of
time.

Despites the disadvantages, constancy of saving money and determination, could be key
to have the opportunity to pay for an abroad trip or just make a complete tour around some
touristic places in their country that they have not known yet. According to the national
institute of statistics in Bolivia (INE), in 2016 the percentage of visitors to the territory had
grown by 8.8%, showing that the number of people traveling is growing over the years.

The tourist activity is growing and expanding in the world market quickly. Despites the
barriers such as the cost and time a trip requires. However, traveling is like in all activity a
matter of priorities and affinities that has become common in people who want to live their

lives fully. Many times it is said that the memories that a trip brings you are much more
valuable than the money and time you may have during the entire existence.
