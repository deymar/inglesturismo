                <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">When it could be said that a company or organization is competitive and successful?
One of the fundamental elements, to define organizations as successful and competitive, is the amount of clients or consumers they have. Nowadays, businesses are competing for: customer dollars and customer Loyalty and year after year, all of them invest in marketing projects and make advertising efforts to bring current and new customer through their doors. 
According to customer services: “it costs significantly more to attract new customers than it does to take care of the ones you already have, and that´s why companies and organizations use CRM. 
But, why they use it? And who it can help to the company? Implementing CRM as a tool in your company could represent a good way to attract new customers and take care of the ones they already have or keep customers loyalty. When we talk about CRM, it might mean any of these three things:
• CRM as a technology: It refers to the use of a technology product called CRM System or Solution. Often in the cloud, this system reports, analyses users interactions with the company and provide a complete record of individuals and companies. It helps companies to stay connected with customers, streamline processes and improve profitability. 
As technology, is important to define the differences between a CRM System and CRM software. According to the definition a CRM software is a program which records contact information such as email, telephone, website social media profile, etc. Websites and Social Media sale the users information to big companies obtained from the cookies and this info is used to promote and sell them their products. It also store client´s personal preferences on communications, creates a 360° view of the customer, captures interactions with the business and surfaces all the information to have better conversations with them. On the other hand, a CRM System organizes the information that CRM software provides to give a complete record of the users and companies online. 
• CRM as strategy: It refers to “Business´ Philosophy” which guide the manner of management that should be applied to relationship with current and potential customers, a plan to use the CRM software to help grow sales and improve customer service, business objectives and customer needs is the important thing, business success, as usual, depends on the right CRM strategy. 
• CRM as a process: It refers to a system that a business adopts to take care of company´s development and management of relationships. A CRM process can be taken as a more complete definition because it includes technologies and strategies used to nurture with existing customers and they’ll be coming back, which means you achieve customer retention and loyalty.
A company or organization can provide good services with CRM such as: develop customer service policies, hire well, provide customer service training, survey your customers and others. It depends of a good CRM process, the companies’ attitude and employee training. To implement CRM is important because it improves informational organization, enhances communication, tracks and have detailed information of a costumer, improves your customer service, greater efficiency for multiple teams and finally, improves analytical data and reporting.
Talking about tourism industry, CRM software metrics of a good hotel and tourism agencies allows you to identify demands and capitalize on opportunities lying in your field of business. Bolivian companies and organizations as: IMCRUZ announced that in 2018 the first CRM software will be launched, dedicated to the Bolivian automotive industry. Other companies such as Bisa Bank, Mi Teleferico, Ketal and others are starting to use CRM for their benefits.
Sadly, some other businesses don´t know the value and the use of the information they have. Information is storage in: big books in a shelf, notebooks, digital information. They don´t use it, they just record it
