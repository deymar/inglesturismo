                <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">The world evolves really fast, as the human population changes and grows. The economy in each country has to adapt itself to these modifications and search for new creative ways to produce incomes for its people. This is why; the future depends on how innovative a person can be! Because the more open minded the person is, the more alternatives he’ll have to succeed.
Nowadays, the industry of tourism is one the most lucrative and innovative compared to the rest of the economic activities. Not only because of its performance when to compete with food or vehicles industries, the way it can adapt through time; but also because today there are countries that fully depend on it.
To explain the importance of tourism, I’ll start talking about the importance of the economic movement it produces. The statistics made by the World Tourism Organization in 2017 show us how 1 of every 10 jobs in the world belong purely to this activity. Also, the estimated number of people a company of tourism hires is 10 persons. Not only the mentioned, but the money it generates in numbers: the direct economic impact of the industry (including accommodation, transportation, entertainment and attractions) is approximately 2.3 trillion U.S. dollars a year (2016).
In addition to this factor, tourism has a multiplier effect. This means that tourism generates an impact in other areas or activities. A clear example of it is when the government must support the private companies of tourism by creating the corresponding infrastructure, in order to help them to provide a better service for the tourists at a specific place. By doing this the government not only helps tourism, but also improves the lives of the population located in that space. The list of actions a Government can do to promote the tourism is long, but some of the most important points are: Secure environments, roads and medical posts.
Furthermore, this industry encourages the creation of Environmental Protection laws and Cultural Preservation activities. Due there are more tourists on the world that travel around the globe looking for authentic experiences, each country wants to protect their natural areas and their cultural heritage. In this way, both the private and the public area have to get together and cooperate to make the right legislation that can help the country look after its belongings.
However, there are some negative counterparts about this activity. For example, the tourist overpopulation in some destinations. This phenomenon damages the environment of a site, especially when a big movement of people weren´t planned.  That’s why, it’s important to promote the arrival of conscious tourist and to prevent the quantity of people a place can sustain.
In conclusion, tourism is an economic activity that can not only generate a big flow in the earnings of a specific site, but also it can improve the lives of the people. It’s an activity that helps us notice the beauty in every corner and also, encourages us to preserve although the changes of time. Tourism can be a powerful weapon that with the correct usage can make a big difference.
