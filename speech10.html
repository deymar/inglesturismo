Nowadays travel around the world it isn’t just for vacations, traveling it is part of the daily
life. Let’s star defining that tourism is the practice of traveling for recreation, so people
travel in order to know new places. Tourism and traveling it isn’t only a way to expend
money but also to experience completely different cultures, cuisines and landscapes, while
you take pictures. Most of scientists said that traveling is a way to improve both the
physical and emotional health of people, so traveling it isn’t only an activity for leisure but
also helps people to escape from a sedentary life.
Moreover tourism an traveling it’s an activity that benefits everyone around the world,
since tourism is an economic activity it contributes not only people who work in hotels,
restaurants or airports, but also countries because visitor expend money in transport, food,
and so on. Also now there are a lot of types of tourism, for example if someone loves
surfing, climbing that people are searching for adventure tourism or if he or she likes to
learn more about new culture that person is looking for an culture tourism, and like this are
so many types of tourism. As a result of the choice made there are still more benefits like
the possibility of discover places you never imagined existed or discover the incredible
cultural diversity. Another significant factor of traveling is how people get out of their
comfort zone, because they can meet people from across the globe and learn new
languages. These are some of the reasons why traveling it more than a leisure activity it’s a
way of live, because every day it’s a new experience.
As we have seen traveling could be one of the best activity for everyone life, but this kind
of life it isn’t that easy, and we can also say that it’s a waste of time. Let’s imagine that
traveling could make people feel amazing every day, because they make new friends an
learn about new cultures, but what happen if someone is poor or that a person should work
all the days of week and also Saturday in order to maintain their family or maybe that
person could suffer from social phobia, so we can say that traveling it isn’t for all the
world. Nowadays there are more effective and interesting ways to try new things, because
you can try something new every week without traveling, for example people instead of
visiting Africa for a month and expend a big amount of money, you can go for a walk
through your local forest and read a book about Africa’s culture. Most people make too
much of a fuss over traveling, because they thing that it is the best way to grow, without
thinking that a career is the most important.
Consequently, we can conclude that traveling beyond being an economic activity is a way
to share with the family or allows people to have a time in order to relax and enjoy. So we
can say that traveling it’s important to learn more things and have new experiences, and
also making memories, but we must know that traveling doesn’t make you a better person,
it’s just a way to learn, but can’t define if it’s the best ore the worst.
